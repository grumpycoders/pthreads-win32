Mailing list

There is a mailing list for discussing pthreads on Win32. To join, send email

Acknowledgements
----------------

Pthreads-win32 is based substantially on a Win32 Pthreads implementation
contributed by John E. Bossom <jebossom@cognos.com>.

See the 'CONTRIBUTORS' file for the list of contributors.


Building under Mingw32
----------------------

pthread.dll can be build with the current development version of mingw32.
Use the GNUmakefile with GNU make should do the right thing.


Why you cannot build the library with Cygwin yet
------------------------------------------------

The DLL pthread.dll still cannot be built using g++ due to non thread-safe
exception handling in g++.  Thanks to Kevin Ruland for researching this
one. See the FAQ Question 2 for more information.

However, you can use the export library libpthread32.a built under
Mingw32 (not tested under Cygwin) together with the pthread.dll built
with MSVC. Thanks to Anders Norlander for pointing this out.

For convenience, the following pre-built files can be downloaded from
the FTP site (see under "Availability" below):

	pthread.h
	semaphore.h
	sched.h
	pthread.dll	- built with MSVC cl compiler
	pthread.lib	- built with MSVC cl compiler
	libpthread32.a	- built with Mingw32 (use with MSVC pthread.dll)

With these files in the same directory as your application myapp.c,
you could compile, link and run myapp.c under Mingw32 as follows:

	gcc -o myapp.exe myapp.c -I. -L. -lpthread32
	myapp

Or put pthread.dll in an appropriate directory in your PATH,
put libpthread32.a in MINGW_ROOT\i386-mingw32\lib, and
put pthread.h in MINGW_ROOT\i386-mingw32\include, then use:

	gcc -o myapp.exe myapp.c -lpthread32
	myapp
