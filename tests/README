Running test cases in this directory
------------------------------------

These make scripts expect to be able to copy the dll, libarary
and header files from this directory's parent directory,
which should be the pthreads-win32 source directory.

MS VC++ nmake
-------------

Run the target corresponding to the DLL version being tested:
 
nmake clean VCE
 
or:
 
nmake clean VSE


GNU G++ make
------------

Run "make clean" and then "make". See the "Known bugs" section
in ..\README.


Writing Test Cases
------------------

Tests written in this test suite should behave in the following manner:

	* If a test fails, leave main() with a result of 1.

	* If a test succeeds, leave main() with a result of 0.

	* No diagnostic output should appear when the test is succeeding.
	  Diagnostic output may be emitted if something in the test
	  fails, to help determine the cause of the test failure.
