 *
 * Module: semaphore.h
 *
 * Purpose:
 *      Semaphores aren't actually part of the PThreads standard.
 *      They are defined by the POSIX Standard:
 *
 *              POSIX 1003.1b-1993      (POSIX.1b)
 *
 *      They are supposed to follow the older UNIX convention for
 *      reporting errors. That is, on failure they are supposed
 *      to return a value of -1 and store the appropriate error
 *      number into 'errno'.
 *      HOWEVER,errno cannot be modified in a multithreaded
 *      program on WIN32; therefore, the value is returned as
 *      the function value.
 *      It is recommended that you compare for zero (0) for success
 *      instead of -1 for failure when checking the status of
 *      these functions.
 *

 *      express or implied, with respect to this software, its
 *      quality, performance, merchantability, or fitness for a
