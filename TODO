Automate the build/test cycle so that I can
expand to test both library and applications in different
environments and cross-environments.

Eg.
           Applications | SEH | C++ | G++ |  C  | GCC |
        Library         |     |     |     |     |     |
        ----------------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
        SEH             |  X  |  X  |  X  |  X  |  X  |
        ----------------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
        C++ (MSC)       |  X  |  X  |  X  |  X  |  X  |
        ----------------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
        G++ (GNU)       |  ?  |  ?  |  X  |  ?  |  X  |
        ----------------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+

'?' indicates combinations that may not be doable.
