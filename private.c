      * This routine creates an association that
      * is unique for the given (thread,key) combination.The association 
      * is referenced by both the thread and the key.
      * This association allows us to determine what keys the
      * current thread references and what threads a given key
      * references.
      * See the detailed description
      * at the beginning of this file for further details.
      *
      * Notes:
      *      1)      New associations are pushed to the beginning of the
      *              chain so that the internal _pthread_selfThreadKey association
      *              is always last, thus allowing selfThreadExit to
      *              be implicitly called by pthread_exit last.
      *
      * Parameters:
      *              assocP
      *                      address into which the association is returned.
      *              thread

      *                      is only added to the key. A NULL thread indicates
      *                      that the user called pthread_setspecific prior
