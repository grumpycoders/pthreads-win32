 * On Windows98, THREAD_PRIORITY_LOWEST is (-2) and

 * 
 * On WinCE 3.0, it so happen that THREAD_PRIORITY_LOWEST is 5
 * and THREAD_PRIORITY_HIGHEST is 1 (yes, I know, it is funny:
 * highest priority use smaller numbers) and the following happens:
 * 
 * sched_get_priority_min() returns 5
 * sched_get_priority_max() returns 1
